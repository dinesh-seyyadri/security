a) Introduction to Layer 2 Security:

Layer 2, the data link layer in the OSI model, provides MAC address based connectivity within a broadcast domain, such as an Ethernet LAN. 
Network technologies are implemented in stacks, broken into layers. 
Each layer has very specific duties. Each layer can only communicate with the layers directly above and directly below itself, following well-defined rules. 
Other than what is passed to direct neighboring layers, the implementation of each layer ignores the complexity of the other layers.0
Each layer depends on the other layers to perform their duties.



Take the example of a web browser and a web server communicating with each other. 
The two applications communicate with each other via a socket that is provided by the transport layer.
Neither application is concerned with the complexity of the transport layer or any layer beneath the transport layer. 
Similarly, the transport layer depends on the network layer to carry packets to and from other systems based on IP addresses. 
The transport layer does not need to deal with the complexity of subnetting and routing. 
Also, the network layer depends on the data link layer to move frames between systems on the same broadcast domain, based on MAC addresses. 
Imagine, in this example, if Layer 2 is compromised at some point. Frames which should be passed between two neighboring routers are instead sent to a man-in-the-middle within that broadcast domain.
Now, all traffic between the web browser and the web server is intercepted by man-in-the-middle, and none of the higher layers have any indication of the security breach.

b) Ethernet Switching Overview:

Ethernet switches implement IEEE 802.1D transparent bridging. 
Switches learn which ports lead to which host MAC addresses by monitoring the source MAC addresses in the Ethernet headers on frames that arrive on their switch ports.
The port to MAC address mappings are stored in MAC address tables. 
The MAC address tables are commonly called CAM tables because many switches uses a special type of technology (Content Addressable Memory) to store the MAC address tables.


If a switch receives a frame that is destined for a MAC address that is in its MAC address table, then that frame is only forwarded out of the appropriate port leading to that MAC address. 
This conserves bandwidth on all the other ports on the switch. 
If the switch receives a frame with a source MAC address that matches an entry for that port in the MAC address table, the frame is not forwarded out of any ports.
If the switch receives a frame that is destined for a MAC address that is not in its MAC address table, it floods the frame out of all ports, except for the port where the frame was received.
If the destination replies to the source, the switch will be able to learn the new MAC address based on the source MAC address in the Ethernet header of the reply.

c)VLAN Overview:

Each VLAN that you configure on the switch implements address learning, forwarding and filtering decisions, and loop avoidance mechanisms as if the VLAN were a separate physical switch.

The Cisco Catalyst switch implements VLANs by restricting traffic forwarding to destination ports that are in the same VLAN as the originating ports.
When a frame arrives on a switch port, the switch must retransmit the frame to only the ports that belong to the same VLAN. 
In essence, a VLAN that is operating on a switch limits transmission of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic. 
Traffic originating from a particular VLAN floods to only the other ports in that VLAN, creating a broadcast domain.

An access port carries only the traffic for the single VLAN to which it belongs.
A trunk port carries traffic for multiple VLANs. Trunk ports are used to carry traffic for multiple VLANs between physical switches.


d)VLAN Configuration:

SwitchX#configure terminal
SwitchX(config)#vlan 2
SwitchX(config-vlan)#name management

Before creating VLANs, consider these guidelines:


Most Cisco Catalyst desktop switches support a maximum of 128 spanning-tree instances.

 > If the number of VLANs on the switch exceeds the number of supported spanning-tree instances, it is recommended that you configure MSTP on your switch to map multiple VLANs to a single spanning-tree instance.

 > The maximum number of VLANs is switch-dependent. Many access-layer Cisco Catalyst switches can support up to 250 user-defined VLANs.

 > Cisco Catalyst switches have a factory default configuration in which various default VLANs are preconfigured to support various media and protocol types. 
   The default Ethernet VLAN is VLAN 1. Cisco Discovery Protocol advertisements and other protocols are sent on VLAN 1.

After configuring the VLAN, you should validate the parameters for that VLAN. Use the show vlan id vlan_id or the show vlan name vlan-name command to display information about a particular VLAN.


********************
SwitchX# show vlan id 2

SwitchX#
******************


Use the show vlan brief command to display one line for each VLAN that displays the VLAN name, the status, and the switch ports.

Use the show vlan command to display information on all configured VLANs. 
The show vlan command displays the switch ports that are assigned to each VLAN. 
Other VLAN parameters that are displayed include the type (the default is Ethernet), the SAID that is used for the FDDI trunk, the MTU (the default is 1500 for Ethernet VLAN), the STP, and other parameters that are used for Token Ring or FDDI VLANs.

After creating a VLAN, 
you can manually assign a port or a number of ports to that VLAN.
An access port can belong to only one VLAN at a time.

On most Cisco Catalyst switches, you configure the VLAN port assignment from interface configuration mode using the switchport access command.


************
SwitchX# configure terminal
SwitchX(config)# interface range fastethernet 0/2 - 4
SwitchX(config-if)# switchport access vlan 2

SwitchX# show vlan

VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
---- -------------------------------- --------- ----------------------
1    default                              active    Fa0/1 
2    management                     active    Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4

*****************************


You can use the vlan vlan_number option in the switchport access command to set VLAN membership.

************
SwitchX(config-if)#switchport access [vlan vlan_number | dynamic]

************

Use the show vlan brief privileged EXEC command to display the VLAN assignment and membership type for all switch ports.
It is important to note that if a given port does not appear in the Ports column of the table, it could be a trunk port carrying multiple VLANs.

****NOTE:It is important to note that if a given port does not appear in the Ports column of the table, it could be a trunk port carrying multiple VLANs.


e)802.1Q Trunking:

A trunk is a point-to-point link between two devices that is capable of carrying multiple VLANs.
Trunks between switches allow many VLANs to be shared between switches using minimal physical connections.
Trunks can also be used to connect other types of network devices. 
For example, a trunk link between a switch and a router allows the router to connect to multiple VLANs and provide Layer 3 gateway functionality for several VLANs over a single physical link. 
Another example is a server running a hypervisor and supporting several VMs.
If that server is connected to a switch via a trunk, then individual VMs can be connected to their appropriate VLANs.


There are two protocols that are used to implement trunks in Ethernet environments.
Cisco pioneered trunking technology with a proprietary protocol called ISL. 
The utility of trunk links was recognized by the industry, and the IEEE ratified the 802.1Q standard for trunking. 
In modern networks, almost all trunking is implemented with the 802.1Q protocol.

802.1Q introduces a tag into the Ethernet header which specifies the VLAN to which the frame should be contained. 
The 802.1Q tag is inserted into the frame header when a frame is sent out a trunk port. 
The 802.1Q tag is stripped from the frame when a receiving switch forwards the frame out an access (nontrunking) port. 
802.1Q uses the concept of a native VLAN. 
A trunk port is assigned a native VLAN. Most network devices assign VLAN 1 as the native VLAN on trunks by default. 
Traffic that is associated with the native VLAN is untagged. 
That is, on egress, if the frame belongs to the native VLAN of the trunk port, an 802.1Q tag is not imposed. 
If the frame belongs to any other VLAN, the appropriate 802.1Q tag is imposed. 
On ingress, if a frame arrives without a tag, it is assigned to the native VLAN.
If a frame arrives with an 802.1Q tag, it is assigned to the VLAN specified by the tag.
Care must be taken to configure the same native VLAN on both ends of a trunk link.


It is very common to implement a trunk between two devices using a single port on each device.
But it is also possible to bind multiple physical ports together to form a single logical link, called a port channel. 
This increases the bandwidth available across the link.
Trunking can be configured on individual physical ports or it can be configured on logical port channels which bind together multiple physical ports.
