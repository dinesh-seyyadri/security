Cryptographic Technologies:

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques to secure communications in the presence of third parties. 
Historically, cryptography was synonymous with encryption. 
Its goal was to keep messages private. In modern times, cryptography includes other responsibilities:

Confidentiality: Ensuring that only authorized parties can read a message.

Data Integrity: Ensuring that any changes to data in transit will be detected and rejected.

Origin Authentication: Ensuring that any messages received were actually sent from the perceived origin.

Non-Repudiation: Ensuring that the original source of a secured message cannot deny having produced the message.
