Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption.
Therefore, the sender and the receiver must share the same secret key before communicating securely. 
The security of a symmetric algorithm rests in the secrecy of the shared key; by obtaining the key, anyone can encrypt and decrypt messages. 
Symmetric encryption is often called secret-key encryption. Symmetric encryption is the more traditional form of cryptography. 
The typical key-length range of symmetric encryption algorithms is 40 to 256 bits.

Because symmetric algorithms are usually quite fast, they are often used for wire-speed encryption in data networks.
Symmetric algorithms are based on simple mathematical operations and can easily be accelerated by hardware.
Because of their speed, you can use symmetric algorithms for bulk encryption when data privacy is required, such as to protect a VPN

On the other hand, key management can be a challenge. 
The communicating parties must obtain a common secret key before any encryption can occur. 
Therefore, the security of any cryptographic system depends greatly on the security of the key management methods.

Symmetric encryption algorithms are sometimes referred to as private-key encryption. 
Examples of symmetric encryption algorithms are DES, 3DES, AES, IDEA, RC2/4/5/6, and Blowfish.
Because of their speed, symmetric algorithms are frequently used for encryption services, with additional key management algorithms providing secure key exchange.
