Authentication -who u are
Authorization - What you are allowed to do
Accounting - log entries and audit trail

AAA stands for authentication, authorization, and accounting. 
 Authentication is about determining identity. 
 Authorization is about defining what individual or groups of identities are allowed to do. 
 Accounting is about keeping track of what individual identities have done.

If authentication requires two things, it is called two factor authentication. 
An example of two factor authentication is a token generating fob that is paired with a PIN. 
To authenticate, the user must provide the current token appearing on the fob (something that they have) along with their PIN (something that they know).

AAA can be associated with network access and with administrative access. 
For example, using a remote access VPN client to connect to the corporate network from other locations is considered network access.
Generally the user is challenged for credentials to log on to the VPN. This logon process is authentication. 
Depending on the user's department, the user may be allowed or denied access to certain resources via the VPN. 
This process is authorization. Lastly, details of the session, such as dates and times, remote IP address, and systems accessed may be logged. This process is accounting. 
Similarly, a staff member of the IT department may log into the router to make a configuration change.
This would be considered administrative access. Again, the IT staff member must authenticate to the router. 
Depending on his position, he may have limited access to configuration commands.
For example, members of the network operations team may be allowed to modify SNMP configuration on the router, but not modify routing protocol configuration. 
This determination is made by the authorization process. Finally, the details of the administrative session may be logged. 
The details may include session start and stop times and commands that were entered.


AAA Databases:

Local and Centralized databases are available for AAA

AAA data must be stored somewhere. 
The simplest implementation is to use the local database on individual network devices. 
This means AAA authentication and authorization data are stored directly in the device’s configuration. 
While simple, using the local AAA database does not scale well. 
Username and password definitions as well as authorization specifications must be configured and maintained on all network devices. 
Imagine password management where passwords must be updated independently on hundreds or thousands of devices. 
Also, understand that configuring usernames and passwords is an administrative act. 
When a remote access VPN system is configured with local AAA,, a user does not normally select their password. 
Instead their password is assigned by an administrator. 
Another shortcoming of local AAA is that it does not support accounting. 
AAA accounting data can build up very quickly and network devices simply don’t have enough persistent storage to support local AAA accounting.



In all but the smallest deployments, centralized AAA is preferred over local AAA.
With centralized AAA, configuration and maintenance of AAA policy is much simpler. 
User IDs are defined and managed centrally and made available all devices in the network. 
Similarly, authorization policy can be defined centrally and made available to all devices in the network. 
Beyond the initial configuration, maintenance is also simplified. 
If an authorization policy is changed, the change is inherited by all devices. 
Centralized AAA also facilitates accounting. The accounting records from all devices are sent to centralized repositories.
Auditing AAA records is simplified when the records are all consolidated in a central repository.

AAA protocols:

AAA protocols allow individual network devices to communicate with the centralized AAA resources
two AAA protocols  RADIUS and TACACS+

RADIUS:

A RADIUS server listens on either UDP 1645 (legacy) or 1812 for authentication and authorization and either UDP 1646 (legacy) or 1813 for accounting.
RADIUS obfuscates passwords that are transmitted between the client and server using a shared secret key and MD5 hashing; however, the rest of the data is sent in clear text.

TACACS: developed by Cisco
TACACS+ servers listen on TCP port 49. 
All data that is transferred between TACACS+ clients and servers is encrypted on a per session basis utilizing session data and a shared secret to derive per session encryption keys.


A significant difference between RADIUS and TACACS+ is how they separate the authentication, authorization, and accounting processes.
RADIUS combines authentication and authorization together in a single process. 
TACACS+ separates all three aspects of AAA into individual processes. 
When a RADIUS client makes an access request, it receives all authorization specifications from the RADIUS server at the time of authentication. 
A TACACS+ client can make realtime authorization requests for an authenticated user or system after the authentication process has completed. 
This behavior makes TACACS+ more flexible with administrative access authorization. 
The AAA client can request authorization requests on a per-command basis as the administrator enters the commands. 
Using TACACS+, per-command authorization is often paired with per-command accounting. 
The two together provide the capability for very detailed authorization models and very robust accounting records. 
There are advantages and disadvantages that are associated with both protocols. 
Often, RADIUS is used for AAA associated with user access to network resources and TACACS+ is used for AAA associated with administrative access to network devices.

AAA Servers:

AAA servers facilitate centralized resources for authentication databases, authorization policy configurations, and accounting records. 
Cisco offers two AAA servers for the enterprise market: Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS), and the Cisco ISE.
Network devices consult the AAA servers for AAA policies. 
The AAA servers may consult other systems for certain aspects of the AAA policy. 
The most common example is consulting an enterprise user ID repository, such as Active Directory or LDAP. 
Maintaining multiple user databases with duplication between the databases is not an optimal situation.
Both ACS and ISE can consult several user repositories for user authentication, including Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS and RSA token servers. 
Both ACS and ISE can also leverage data from the user repository, such as group membership, when making authorization policy decisions.

Cisco Secure ACS is a robust AAA server offering both TACACS+ and RADIUS services in one system. 
With ACS, an organization can centralize both user network access policies and network device administrative access policies in one server.

Cisco ISE is a next-generation identity management system that adds features such as profiling, posture assessment, and centralized web authentication.
