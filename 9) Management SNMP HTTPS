Network management protocols can be classified in different ways.
The three common methodologies that are offered by network devices are a CLI, a web-based GUI, and SNMP.

Access to a device’s CLI can be provided by physical connections to the console port or AUX port. 
This direct serial connection to the device can facilitate an out of band management access method. 
The CLI can also be reached via networking protocols via a device’s VTY lines. In the past, Telnet was commonly used as a protocol for accessing a network device’s CLI. 
While the use of Telnet does persist, its popularity is waning due to security concerns. 
Telnet does not provide any privacy. Not only is the data sent clear text, authentication credentials are also sent clear text. 
If an attacker can sniff a Telnet session, they can capture the administrator’s username and password.
Because of this, SSH has become the standard for CLI access via the network. 
SSH provides the ability for the client to verify the identity of the server (the network device), preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. 
Also, it protects the authentication credentials and the data using encryption.

Many network devices offer web-based GUIs. 
The robustness of the GUI varies from platform to platform. On the ASA platform, ASDM, is a very robust platform and is often preferred by administrators over the CLI. 
On the other hand, IOS devices offer less robust web-based GUIs and administrators often prefer to use the CLI on IOS devices. 
Some devices offer access to the web-based GUI via either HTTP or HTTPS. 
Similar to SSH and Telnet, HTTPS is preferred over HTTP from a security perspective. 
HTTPS allows the client to verify the identity of the network device and it protects the administrator’s credentials and all data passing over the network.

The third option for configuration management across the network is SNMP. 
SNMP uses the concept of a MIB to store configuration and status information that is associated with a device. 
MIBs are organized in a tree structure with branches and entries that are specified by an OID. 
There are three main mechanisms for SNMP communication between a network management system and a network device.
A network management system can retrieve configuration and status information from a device using SNMP GET operations. 
It can also update configuration data in a MIB with an SNMP SET operation.
When the configuration data is modified in the MIB, it is also modified in the device’s running configuration. 
The third mechanism is the use of an SNMP TRAP operation which allows a network device to send unsolicited updates to a network management station.
A variation of the TRAP is an INFORM. 
The device expects the SNMP manager to reply to an INFORM but not a TRAP. Devices will queue and resend unacknowledged INFORMs.

SNMP has evolved through three versions. 
SNMP versions 1 and 2 do not provide much security. 
Operations are controlled with community strings.
Community strings can be read-only or read-write.
GET requests will be honored if the network management system provides either a valid read-only or read-write community string. 
SET requests require the network management system to provide a read-write community string.
With SNMP versions 1 and 2, all data is sent in clear text, including the community strings. 
If an attacker can sniff the SNMP communications, they can extract the read-write community strings. 
It is just as dangerous for an attacker to have the read-write community string as it is for an attacker to have the enable secret of an IOS device.
