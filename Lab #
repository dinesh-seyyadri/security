Task 1

SNMPv3 makes use of engine IDs to uniquely identify each system. 
The main requirement of the engine ID is that it be unique for each device on the managed network.
The engine ID is a 24 hexadecimal digit value. 
The IOS CLI requires that you configure at least 10 digits, and it will append extra zeros if fewer than 24 digits are configured.
Access the console Rtr-1, access global configuration mode, and define the router’s own (local) engine ID to be 0123456789.

snmp-server engineID local 0123456789

Task 2:

SNMP uses the concept of a Management Information Base (MIB).
MIBs are databases of status and configuration information that are stored in tree structures.
A management system requests access to parts of the database by specifying the path that is taken from the root to the data’s location. 
For example, the path 1.3.6.1.2.1 takes you to MIB-2’s location. 
From there, there are several branches. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1 is where system data is stored, 1.3.6.1.2.1.2 is where interface data is stored, 1.3.6.1.2.1.4 is where IP data is stored, etc.
The MIB path is generally referred to as an OID, or Object ID.
Views can be defined which limit which branches of the tree are available for reading or writing by different SNMP management systems.
By default, with SNMPv3 on IOS, the entire MIB tree is available for read and nothing is available for write.
Define an SNMP view, named write-view, which will include access to all branches below 1.3.6.1.2.1.

Task 3:

SNMPv3 groups are used to define security settings and privileges that may be used by users who are members of the group. 
There are three security modes available in SNMPv3:
 1) noauth provides no cryptographic security.
 2) auth provides data integrity via cryptographic hashes.
 3) priv provides data integrity and also adds encryption based privacy.
 
 The syntax for the snmp-server group command is as follows:
 
 snmp-server group group-name { v1 | v2c | v3 { auth | noauth | priv } } [ context context-name ] [ read read-view ] [ write write-view ] [ notify notify-view ] [access [ ipv6 named-access-list ] [ acl-number | acl-name ] ]Configure an SNMP version 3 group named test-group with priv mode security that is provided write authorization as defined by the view named write-view.
