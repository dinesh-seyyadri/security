show run | section enable

Note the following:

You know that the value of the enable secret is cisco, because you just used it to access privilege level 15. 
But the Pod-Rtr does not know what the enable secret value actually is. Remember, hashes are one-way transforms. 
The Pod-Rtr knows the resulting hash, but not the original secret string.
Borrowing from the BSD notation that is used for passwords that are stored in /etc/shadow, there are three components to the secret, 
each preceded by a $.

The $1 specifies that MD5 transformation is used. This is the only transform supported by IOS. *nix systems support other methods.
The $yvQJ is a random four-character salt phrase that was generated when the enable secret was originally configured.
The $SK2/1KIZXwUY/7/P36C4I0 is the MD5 hash of the secret cisco combined with the salt yvQJ.

As stated above, the Rtr does not know what the enable secret is. 
It just knows that the enable secret salted with yvQJ is SK2/1KIZXwUY/7/P36C4I0. When you entered the string cisco at the password prompt, the Pod-Rtr took the string that you entered, combined it with the yvQJ salt phrase, performed the MD5 transform, and compared the result to the stored hash. 
Since they matched, the Pod-Rtr accepted the password and granted access to privileged mode.

on Kali linux:

openssl passwd -1 -salt yvQJ cisco
