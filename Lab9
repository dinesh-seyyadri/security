1)
Access the console of the Site2-Rtr and access global configuration mode.
Site2-Rtr>en
Site2-Rtr#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Site2-Rtr(config)#

2)Begin configuring an ISAKMP policy with priority 20.

Site2-Rtr(config)#crypto isakmp policy 20
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#

3)
Configure SHA-1 as the hash algorithm, preshared key as the authentication method, Diffie-Hellman group 2, an 86,400 second lifetime, and 128-bit AES as the encryption algorithm.4

Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#hash sha
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#authentication pre-share
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#group 2
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#lifetime 86400
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#encryption aes 128

4)
Display the ISAKMP policy that is configured in the running configuration:
Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#do show running-config | section crypto
crypto isakmp policy 20
 encr aes 
 authentication pre-share 
 group 2

Note:
Neither the hash command nor the lifetime command shows up in the configuration. This is because the default hash algorithm is SHA-1 and the default lifetime is 86400 seconds (24 hours).
128 does not show up as an argument in the encr aes command. Again, this is because 128 bits is the default for AES. If you would have specified 192 or 256 bits, then that argument would show up in the running configuration.

5)

Display the ISAKMP policies that are currently in effect on the Site2-Rtr.

Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#do show crypto isakmp policy
Global IKE policy
Protection suite of priority 20
   encryption algorithm:   AES - Advanced Encryption Standard (128 bit keys).
   hash algorithm:         Secure Hash Standard
   authentication method:  Pre-Shared Key
   Diffie-Hellman group:   #2 (1024 bit)
   lifetime:               86400 seconds, no volume limit

note:
Displaying the ISAKMP policies in this way provides all the settings, including those that are Cisco IOS default settings.

6)

The policy specifies preshared key for authentication, therefore, the preshared key must be defined. Specify the string KeyForSite3Site2 as the preshared key to use with the Site3-Rtr (192.168.3.2)

Site2-Rtr(config-isakmp)#exit
Site2-Rtr(config)#crypto isakmp key KeyForSite3Site2 address 192.168.3.2

Configure the IPsec Policy:

For the Site2-Rtr to peer with the Site3-Rtr and use IPsec to protect traffic between Site2 and Site3, three things must be identified in its configuration. 
1) Which traffic to protect? 2) How to protect that traffic? 3) Where to send the protected traffic? 
These three things are identified in a crypto map. 
The crypto map references an ACL to specify interesting traffic.
It references a transform-set to specify how to protect the interesting traffic. 
It references a peer to specify where to send the protected traffic.
In this section of the discovery, you will configure the elements of the crypto map and you will apply the crypto map to interface Gi0/2.

7)
Configure an extended IP ACL named Site3-VPN that permits IP traffic from 10.10.2.0/24 to 10.10.3.0/24.

Site2-Rtr(config)#ip access-list extended Site3-VPN
Site2-Rtr(config-ext-nacl)#permit ip 10.10.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.3.0 0.0.0.255

8)

Define a transform-set named Transform1 that specifies the use of the Encapsulating Security Payload protocol with 128-bit AES encryption and SHA-1 as the HMAC algorithm.

Site2-Rtr(config-ext-nacl)#exit
Site2-Rtr(config)#crypto ipsec transform-set Transform1 esp-aes esp-sha-hmac


9)

Define entry number 10 in a crypto map named VPN-map using ipsec-isakmp as the tunnel type. 
Specify the ACL you just created (Site3-VPN) as the crypto ACL.
Specify the transform-set you just created (Transform1) as the transform-set. Set the peer to the Site3-Rtr (192.168.3.2).


Site2-Rtr(cfg-crypto-trans)#exit
Site2-Rtr(config)#crypto map VPN-map 10 ipsec-isakmp
% NOTE: This new crypto map will remain disabled until a peer
        and a valid access list have been configured.
Site2-Rtr(config-crypto-map)#match address Site3-VPN
Site2-Rtr(config-crypto-map)#set transform-set Transform1
Site2-Rtr(config-crypto-map)#set peer 192.168.3.2

10)

Assign the crypto map to interface Gi0/2.

Site2-Rtr(config-crypto-map)#exit
Site2-Rtr(config)#int g0/2  
Site2-Rtr(config-if)#crypto map VPN-map
*Dec  9 16:54:18.194: %CRYPTO-6-ISAKMP_ON_OFF: ISAKMP is ON

 Configure Hub and Spoke Site-to-Site VPN
 Site-to-site VPN was already configured between Site 3 and Site 4. 
 You just finished configuring site-to-site VPN between Site 2 and Site 3. 
 The configuration of the crypto ACLs on the three routers can be adjusted to allow hub and spoke VPN between Site 2 and Site 4, using the Site3-Rtr as the hub. 
 The crypto ACLs used between the Site2-Rtr and Site3-Rtr need to include traffic between Site 2 and Site 4. 
 The crypto ACLs used between Site3-Rtr and Site4-Rtr also need to include traffic between Site 2 and Site 4.
 You will perform the appropriate crypto ACL updates in this section of the discovery exercise.
 
 16)Display the crypto ACL configured on the Site2-Rtr.

    10 permit ip 10.10.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.3.0 0.0.0.255 (17 matches)



17)Add an entry to the Site3-VPN ACL that will permit IP traffic from Site2 (10.10.2.0/24) to Site 4 (10.10.4.0/24).


Site2-Rtr#conf t

*Dec  9 18:23:40.766: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by console


Note the following:
As the implementation of the VPN changes, the names that were originally chosen for the crypto ACLs become less appropriate. 
The name Site3-VPN was appropriate when the ACL identified VPN traffic that is destined for Site 3. 
Now that it also identifies traffic to Site 4, better choices for the ACL name may have been VpnThroughSite3 or VPN-To-Hub or other similar names. 
In the temporary lab environment, we won’t bother to change the ACL names. 
In a production environment, it is best to understand the long-term requirements before implementing configurations, and also to choose appropriate and meaningful names for the configuration elements.

18)Verify that there are now two entries in the Site3-VPN ACL that permit traffic from Site 2 to Site 3 and Site 2 to Site 4, respectively.

Site2-Rtr#show access-list
Extended IP access list Site3-VPN
    10 permit ip 10.10.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.3.0 0.0.0.255 (17 matches)
    20 permit ip 10.10.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.4.0 0.0.0.255

19)Access the console of the Site3-Rtr. Display the ACLs that are configured on the Site3-Rtr.

20)The ACL named Site3-to-Site2 is referenced in the crypto map entry that is associated with the Site2-Rtr. 
   Similarly, the ACL named Site3-to-Site4 is referenced in the crypto map entry that is associated with the Site4-Rtr. 
   Both ACLs only permit IP traffic that is sourced from Site3 (10.10.3.0/24). 
   Add an entry to the Site3-to-Site2 ACL that permits IP traffic that is sourced from Site4 (10.10.4.0/24) and destined to Site2 (10.10.2.0/24). 
   Also, add an entry to the Site3-to-Site4 ACL that permits IP traffic that is sourced from Site2 (10.10.2.0/24) and destined to Site4 (10.10.4.0/24).

23) 
As you probably expected, the crypto ACL only permits IP traffic from Site 4 to Site 3. Add an entry to the ACL that permits IP traffic from Site 4 (10.10.4.0/24) to Site 2 (10.10.2.0/24).

25)
Access the desktop of the Site2-Srv. Use the Terminal window to ping the Site4-Srv (10.10.4.10). This should succeed. Use <Ctrl-C> to terminate the ping.

26)

Access the console of the Site2-Rtr. Display the IPsec SAs that are active on the Site2-Rtr. The output will be long, but you should note that there are a total of four IPsec SAs now. Two are inbound and two are outbound. Two are associated with traffic from Site 2 to Site 3 and were negotiated and verified earlier in the lab. Two are new and associated with traffic from Site 2 to Site 4. Note: Parts of the following output have been omitted and comments have been inserted into the output. This has been done to highlight the existence of the four IPsec SAs.

The IPSec peer for traffic from Site 2 to Site 4 is 192.168.3.2, the Site3-Rtr. Traffic between Site 2 and Site 4 must traverse the Site3-Rtr as a hub.
It is important to understand that there are unique IPsec SAs per line of the crypto ACLs. The SAs are negotiated when interesting traffic matches a particular line in the ACL.

 Move to the console of Site3-Rtr. Display the status of the IPsec-SAs on Site3-Rtr. 
 Note: Since Site3-Rtr is not only configured with multiple line crypto ACLs, but also it is configured with multiple IPsec peers, there will be even more output to sift through. 
 But taking the time to examine the output can be enlightening.
 Again, parts of the following output have been omitted and comments have been inserted into the output.

Note the following:
The proxy that is listed above will protect IP traffic from 10.10.4.0/24 to 10.10.2.0/24. Again, this proxy is defined by the other line that you added to the Site3-Rtr crypto ACLs earlier in this exercise. It allows the Site3-Rtr to act as a hub between Site 4 and Site 2.

Note the following:
The proxy that is listed above will protect IP traffic between 10.10.3.0/24 and 10.10.4.0/24. While the Site3-Rtr and Site4-Rtr are configured for IPsec between them, there has been no interesting traffic to trigger negotiation of these IPsec SAs. Therefore there is none that are listed below. If you generate interesting traffic (such as pinging the Site4-Srv from the Site3-Srv), then these SAs would be negotiated.
