1) ASA’s GUI management application Adaptive Security Device Manager using the icon on the desktop.
   Connect to ASA-1 (10.10.10.1), authenticating as admin with the password Cisco123!.

2) Minimize the ASDM window and use PuTTY to establish an SSH connection to ASA-1. Launch PuTTY using the icon on the desktop. 
Either type 10.10.10.1 in the IP address field and click Open, or double-click the ASA-1 entry under Saved Sessions. 
Again, authenticate as admin with the password Cisco123!. 
Also, use the enable command to access privilege level 15. There is no enable secret configured. Simply hit Enter at the password prompt.

3) In the next few steps, you will observe the behavior of ASA-1 and Rtr-2 with traffic between the four Kali PC’s.
For now, simply access each of their desktops, one at a time. On each, open a terminal window using the desktop icon.
Also, verify that the default gateway setting is as expected using the command netstat –rn

root@Kali-11:~# netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination    Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0        10.10.10.1      0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.10.10.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0

4) Access the desktop of Kali-22. 
Using the terminal window, ping Kali-12 (10.10.10.12). The ping should succeed. Use Ctrl-C to terminate the ping

5) Establish an FTP session from Kali-22 to Kali-12. Log in as anonymous. A password is not required. 
Use the dir command to retrieve the directory information through an FTP data connection.
Finally, use the bye command to terminate the FTP session

8)
Access ASDM from the desktop of the Admin-PC. 
Navigate to Configuration > Device Setup > Interfaces. Examine the interface configuration table.

9)

Access the desktop of Kali-11. 
Open the Iceweasel web browser and attempt to browse Kali-21 (10.10.20.21). Kali-21’s web page should display successfully
