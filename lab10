Execute the Site-to-Site VPN Wizard
1)

Access the desktop of the Site1-PC. Use the desktop icon to launch Cisco ASDM. Connect to the Site1-ASA (10.10.1.1), authenticating as admin with the password Cisco123!.

2)
In Cisco ASDM, from the drop-down menus at the top of the window, navigate to: Wizards > VPN Wizards > Site-to-Site VPN Wizard.

3)
Click Next in the Introduction window.

4)

On the Peer Device Identification window, enter 192.168.3.2 in the Peer IP Address field and select the interface outside. Click Next.

5)

On the Traffic to Protect window, enter 10.10.1.0/24 in the Local Network field and 10.10.3.0/24 in the Remote Network field. ASDM may change 10.10.1.0/24 to inside-network. This is OK. Click Next.

6)

On the Security Panel, select Simple Configuration and enter KeyForSite3Site1. Click Next.

7)

Understanding the interaction of NAT with VPN is very important, and you will work with this later in the lab. Currently the Site1-ASA is not configured to perform NAT, so there is no NAT to exempt. For now, simply click Next on the NAT Exempt window.

8)

Examine the Summary window.

9)

Click Finish. The Preview CLI Commands window opens, displaying the commands that will be sent to the Cisco ASA. Examine the commands. If they appear correct, click Send. If they do not, click Cancel and retrace your steps.

 ASDM offers a unique troubleshooting tool called Packet Tracer. 
 Currently there is no problem to troubleshoot, but you will gain some exposure to the tool in this section of the discovery. 
 You will use the Packet Tracer tool again in a later section of the discovery, when there is an issue. 
 Seeing the normal output now will make it easier to read the abnormal output later.
 
 In ASDM, select Tools > Packet Tracer. The Packet Tracer window opens.
 
 23)
 
 In ASDM, select Tools > Packet Tracer. The Packet Tracer window opens.
 
 24)
 
 Define the following in the Packet Tracer input fields:
Interface: inside
Packet Type: TCP
Source: IP Address/10.10.1.10
Destination: IP Address/10.10.3.10
Source Port: 1024
Destination Port: 80

25)Uncheck the Show Animation box to increase the response speed of the tool. Then click Start. The packet-tracer CLI command is displayed in the Preview CLI Commands window. Click Send.

26)

The Packet Tracer output shows several steps of processing that the Site1-ASA would take on this packet. Take a moment to examine the output.


Note the following:
There are two VPN steps in the process flow. If you expand them, you will see that they represent encrypting the packet and sending the packet through the VPN tunnel.
The Packet Tracer output shows all the processing that the packet would receive.
The result is that the packet is allowed. If the packet would be dropped, you could see at which point in its processing that the drop decision was made.

27)Close the Packet Tracer window.



Configure PAT on the Site1-ASA

In this section of the discovery, you will first attempt to connect to the Internet-Srv from the Site1-PC. 
You will see that this fails because reply packets from the Internet-Srv cannot be routed back to the Site1-PC. 
The Core-Rtr does not have routes for the private 10.10.1.0/24 subnet. 
You will then configure the ASA to implement PAT for outbound connections from the 10.10.1.0/24 subnet.
The translated address will be the interface address bound to the Site1-ASA outside interface. 
You will then verify that the Site1-PC can connect to the Internet-Srv, and examine the active translation table on the Site1-ASA.

28)
Verify that you cannot connect from the Site1 network to the Internet-Srv. 
Following the process in the next few steps, you will see that the TCP SYN packet from Site1 does indeed get forwarded to the Internet-Srv, but the Internet-Srv cannot reply because the Core-Rtr does not have routes for the 10.10.1.0/24 private network. 
Begin by accessing the desktop of the Internet-Srv.


29)

Open a Terminal window and enter the command wireshark to launch the Wireshark packet capture and analysis tool.

30)

In the Capture pane, select the interface eth0 and click Start.

31)

Packet capture should start. You may see spanning tree protocol BPDUs being captured.

32)

Return to the desktop of the Site1-PC. Be ready to return to the console of the Internet-Srv quickly after finishing this step. Using the Command Prompt window, enter the command ftp 192.168.100.20 to initiate a connection attempt to the Internet-Srv.

33)

Quickly return to the Internet-Srv and use the red square icon to stop the packet capture.

34)

Take a moment to analyze the captured packets.

35)

Return to the desktop of the Site1-PC. The FTP client should still be running in the Command Prompt window. Use the command bye to terminate the FTP client.

36)

In the next few steps, you will configure PAT for outbound traffic from the 10.10.1.0 network to the IP address of the Site1-ASA outside interface. Begin by navigating to Configuration > Firewall > NAT Rules in ASDM. The (empty) NAT configuration table is displayed.

37)

Select Add > Add “Network Object” NAT Rule. The Add Network Object window opens.

38)

Specify the following field definitions. Leave other fields at their default value. When done, click OK.
Name: Site1
Type: Network
IP Address: 10.10.1.0
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
NAT Type: Dynamic PAT (Hide)
Translated Addr: outsid

40)

In the ASDM main window, click Apply. The Preview CLI Commands window opens, displaying the commands that will be sent to the Cisco ASA. Examine the commands. If they appear correct, click Send. If they do not, click Cancel and retrace your steps.

object network Site1 
        subnet 10.10.1.0 255.255.255.0 
        nat (any,outside) dynamic interface
        
41)

Now verify the PAT function. Begin by using Firefox on the Site1-PC to browse to http://192.168.100.20. The home page of the Internet-Srv should be displayed.

Navigate to the Address page of the Internet-Srv web site. You should see that the client IP address that this server sees is 192.168.1.2 (the IP address of the Site1-ASA outside interface).

Configure NAT Exemption on the Site1-ASA

Now that PAT is configured, outbound connectivity to public networks is functional. But there is a side effect on VPN traffic. PAT will also affect traffic from Site1 to Site3. The VPN is configured with traffic between 10.10.1.0/24 and 10.10.3.0/24 as interesting. The PAT translated traffic to and from 192.168.1.2 (the Site1-ASA outside interface address) is not considered interesting. At this point, the VPN is nonfunctional. While you may consider an option to make the translated traffic interesting, understand that PAT is only effective for outbound connections. The intent of the site-to-site VPN is to allow bidirectional connectivity. For example, the Site3-Srv should be able to initiate connections to either the Site1-PC or the Site1-Srv, but it cannot if PAT is used as the translation technology.
The solution that you will implement in this section of the discovery is to configure NAT exemption. You will configure a NAT rule in front of the PAT rule that explicitly translates 10.10.1.0/24 addresses to themselves if the destination network is 10.10.3.0/24. You will first verify that the VPN is currently nonfunctional, then you will configure NAT exemption, then you will verify VPN and NAT functionality.

Verify that you can no longer reach the Site3-Srv from the Site1-PC. Using the Firefox web browser, attempt to browse to 10.10.3.10. This should not succeed.
Task 43
In the next few steps, you will examine what the Packet Tracer tool now shows for packets from the Site1-PC to the Site3-Srv. Begin by accessing ASDM on the Site1-PC and launching the Packet Tracer tool via Tools > Packet Tracer.
Task 44 Show Me
Verify that the input fields are still at the following values:
Interface: inside
Packet Type: TCP
Source: IP Address/10.10.1.10
Destination: IP Address/10.10.3.10
Source Port: 1024
Destination Port: 80
Task 45
Click Start. The packet-tracer CLI command is displayed in the Preview CLI Commands window. Click Send.
Task 46 Show Me
The Packet Tracer output is quite different this time. Notice that the packet was not even considered for VPN processing. Expand the first NAT processing. You can see that the source address is translated to 192.168.1.2. At this point, it is no longer interesting traffic for the VPN. The packet is forwarded, cleartext, out the outside interface. The Core-Rtr would drop that cleartext packet because it does not have a route to 10.10.3.0/24.
Task 47
Close the Packet Tracer window.
Task 48
In the next few steps, you will configure a network object that is named Site3 that maps to the 10.10.3.0/24 network. Begin by navigating to Configuration > Firewall > Objects > Network Objects/Groups in Cisco ASDM. The Network Objects table is displayed.




Select Add > Network Object. The Add Network Object window opens.
Task 50 Show Me
Most of the default values are appropriate. Verify that the Type is Network, the IP version is IPv4, and the Netmask is 24 bits. Set the Name to Site3 and the IP address to 10.10.3.0.
Task 51
Click OK.
Task 52 Show Me
In the ASDM main window, click Apply. The Preview CLI Commands window opens, displaying the commands that will be sent to the ASA. Examine the commands. If they appear correct, click Send. If they do not, click Cancel and retrace your steps.
Task 53
In the next few steps, you will create the rule to exempt NAT for traffic between 10.10.1.0 and 10.10.3.0. Begin by navigating to Configuration > Firewall > NAT Rules in ASDM. The NAT rules table is displayed.
Task 54 Show Me
Select Add > Add NAT Rule Before “Network Object” NAT Rules. The Add NAT Rule window opens.
Task 55 Show Me
Set the Match Criteria: Original Packet fields as follows:
Source Interface: Inside
Destination Interface: Outside
Source Address: Site1
Destination Address: Site3
Service: Any
Task 56 Show Me
The Action: The Translated Packet field defaults are appropriate for the scenario. Verify that the Source NAT Type is Static, and Original is specified for both the Source Address and Destination Address.
Task 57
Leave the rest of the options at their default values as well. Click OK on the Add NAT Rule window. A message indicating potential issues between Identity NAT and Proxy ARP is displayed. In this scenario, it will not matter whether Proxy ARP remains enabled or not. Simply click Yes to dismiss the message.
Task 58 Show Me
In the ASDM main window, click Apply. The Preview CLI Commands window opens, displaying the commands that will be sent to the ASA. Examine the commands. If they appear correct, click Send. If they do not, click Cancel and retrace your steps.
Task 59 Show Me
Take a moment to examine how both the network object-based PAT rule and the Identity NAT rule are displayed in the NAT rules table by ASDM.
Task 60
Verify connectivity and NAT exemption from Site1 to Site3. Begin by using Firefox on the Site1-PC to browse to the Site3-Srv (10.10.3.10). This should succeed.
Task 61
Navigate to the Address page on the Site3-Srv website. It should show that the client IP address that this server sees is 10.10.1.10 (the original IP address of the Site1-PC).
Task 62
Now verify connectivity and NAT from Site1 to the Internet-Srv. Begin by using Firefox on the Site1-PC to browse to the Internet-Srv (192.168.100.20). This should succeed.
Task 63
Navigate to the Address page on the Site3-Srv website. It should show that the client IP address that this server sees is 192.168.1.2 (the PAT translation to the IP address of the Site1-ASA outside interface).
Task 64
In the last few steps of this discovery, you will view the active translation table on the Site1-ASA using the show xlate command. Begin by selecting Tools > Command Line Interface in ASDM.
Task 65
Select Single Line, enter show xlate as the command, and click Send.
Task 66 Show Me
Review the output of the command.
